\`\`\`typescript
// Example code block - Zod schema for validating emoji-only posts
import { z } from 'zod';

const emojiPostSchema = z.string().regex(/^(\\p{Emoji_Presentation}|\\p{Emoji}\\uFE0F)$/u, {
  message: "Posts can only contain emojis",
});

// Function to validate and create a new post
function createPost(content: string) {
  const validation = emojiPostSchema.safeParse(content);
  if (!validation.success) {
    throw new Error(validation.error.errors[0].message);
  }
  // Code to save the post to the database...
}
