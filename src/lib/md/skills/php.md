# PHP

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used, open-source scripting language primarily designed for web development. It is embedded within HTML and can be used to create dynamic, interactive web pages and applications. PHP's extensive ecosystem, including frameworks like Laravel and Symfony, and its integration with various databases make it a versatile choice for server-side scripting.

## My Experience

I have employed PHP to build various web applications and services, leveraging its ability to handle server-side logic and interact with databases. PHP's simplicity and flexibility, combined with its vast array of libraries and frameworks, have enabled me to develop scalable and feature-rich applications efficiently.
