# C#

C# is a versatile and powerful language developed by Microsoft, known for its simplicity, modern features, and strong support for object-oriented programming. Itâ€™s widely used in enterprise software, web applications, and game development through the Unity engine.

## My Experience

I've used C# extensively in developing web applications, desktop software, and games. Its strong integration with the .NET ecosystem and rich libraries have allowed me to build efficient, scalable solutions across various platforms. C#'s modern syntax and features like LINQ, async/await, and strong typing have made it a go-to language for many of my projects.
