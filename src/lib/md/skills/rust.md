# Rust

## Overview
Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. Known for its rigorous compile-time checks and zero-cost abstractions, Rust is ideal for performance-critical applications. My experience with Rust includes personal projects, learning resources, and practical applications using various tools and libraries.

## My Experience with Rust
I have delved into Rust through various learning resources, including books and online tutorials. I have tackled Rustlings exercises, built CRUD applications, and developed APIs to deepen my understanding of the language. I also have experience with key libraries in the Rust ecosystem, such as Actix, Axum, and Tokio, which are essential for building robust and efficient applications.

## Project-Specific Examples

### 1. CRUD Application
Developed a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application in Rust to learn the fundamentals of web development and API design using Rust's ecosystem.

#### Key Technologies Used
- **Actix**: A powerful and pragmatic web framework for building web applications with Rust.
- **Tokio**: An asynchronous runtime for writing reliable, asynchronous applications.
- **Diesel**: A safe and extensible ORM and query builder for interacting with databases.

#### Key Features
- **API Endpoints**: Implemented RESTful API endpoints for managing data in the CRUD application.
- **Database Integration**: Used Diesel for database interactions, ensuring type safety and ease of use.
- **Concurrency**: Leveraged Tokio to handle asynchronous operations and improve application performance.

```rust
// Example code block - Actix Web API Endpoint

use actix_web::{web, App, HttpServer, Responder};

async fn get_item() -> impl Responder {
    "Item details"
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new()
            .route("/item", web::get().to(get_item))
    })
    .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
    .run()
    .await
}
