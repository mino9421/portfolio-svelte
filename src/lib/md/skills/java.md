# Java

## Overview
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language widely used in enterprise environments. It is known for its portability across platforms, robustness, and extensive ecosystem. Java is particularly popular for building large-scale, high-performance applications.

## My Experience with Java
In various projects, including a CRUD application, I have extensively used Java, particularly with the Spring Boot framework. Spring Boot simplifies the development of production-ready applications by providing a set of conventions and pre-configured components, which streamline development and improve productivity.

## Project-Specific Example: CRUD Application
One of my notable projects was a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Spring Boot. This project demonstrated Javaâ€™s strengths in building robust backend services and managing data persistence efficiently.

### Key Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Framework used for building the backend application, providing out-of-the-box configurations for rapid development.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Used for data persistence, simplifying database interactions with a repository pattern.
- **Hibernate**: ORM framework used in conjunction with Spring Data JPA for managing database operations.
- **Thymeleaf**: Template engine used for rendering views in a web application.
- **MySQL**: Database used to store application data.

### Key Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Implemented full CRUD functionality allowing users to create, read, update, and delete records.
- **REST API**: Developed a RESTful API for interacting with the application, enabling integration with front-end clients or other services.
- **Data Validation**: Incorporated validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity and provide user feedback.

```java
// Example code block - Spring Boot Controller for CRUD operations

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import java.util.List;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/items")
public class ItemController {

    @Autowired
    private ItemService itemService;

    @GetMapping
    public ResponseEntity<List<Item>> getAllItems() {
        List<Item> items = itemService.findAll();
        return new ResponseEntity<>(items, HttpStatus.OK);
    }

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<Item> createItem(@RequestBody Item item) {
        Item createdItem = itemService.save(item);
        return new ResponseEntity<>(createdItem, HttpStatus.CREATED);
    }

    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<Item> updateItem(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Item item) {
        Item updatedItem = itemService.update(id, item);
        return new ResponseEntity<>(updatedItem, HttpStatus.OK);
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<Void> deleteItem(@PathVariable Long id) {
        itemService.delete(id);
        return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT);
    }
}
