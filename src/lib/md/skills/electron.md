# Electron.js

## Overview
Electron.js is a framework that enables the development of cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows developers to build desktop applications with the same codebase used for web applications, leveraging Node.js and Chromium.

## My Experience with Electron.js

### Understanding and Usage
Though my experience with Electron.js is minimal, I have a good understanding of its core principles and capabilities. Electron.js is well-known for powering applications like Discord and Slack, providing a seamless experience across different operating systems by combining web technologies with native system functionalities.

#### Key Concepts
- **Main Process**: Manages the application's lifecycle and communicates with the renderer processes. Handles tasks such as creating windows and managing application-level events.
- **Renderer Process**: Responsible for rendering the application's user interface and running web technologies. Each window in an Electron app runs in its own renderer process.
- **IPC (Inter-Process Communication)**: Enables communication between the main process and renderer processes, allowing for interaction between different parts of the application.

### Example Code Block
```javascript
// Example code block - Basic Electron.js Main Process Script
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');

function createWindow () {
  // Create the browser window.
  let mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    webPreferences: {
      nodeIntegration: true
    }
  });

  // Load the index.html of the app.
  mainWindow.loadFile('index.html');
}

// This method will be called when Electron has finished
// initialization and is ready to create browser windows.
app.whenReady().then(() => {
  createWindow();

  app.on('activate', () => {
    if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) createWindow();
  });
});

// Quit when all windows are closed.
app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') app.quit();
});
