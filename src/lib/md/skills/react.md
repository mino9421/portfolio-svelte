# React.js

## Overview
React.js is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where efficiency and responsiveness are key. Its component-based architecture allows developers to create reusable UI elements, making it easier to manage and scale complex applications.

## My Experience with React.js
In the Deez social media platform, React.js was the backbone of the user interface. Leveraging React's efficient rendering and state management capabilities, I built a dynamic and responsive application that allowed users to interact with the platform in real-time. The component-based approach of React also made it easier to maintain and scale the application as new features were added.

## Project-Specific Example
One of the key components in Deez was the `EmojiFeed`, which displayed a real-time feed of emoji-only posts. React's state management and lifecycle methods were crucial in ensuring that the feed updated seamlessly as new posts were added.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { trpc } from '../utils/trpc';

function EmojiFeed() {
  const { data: posts } = trpc.useQuery(['getPosts']);

  return (
    <div>
      {posts?.map((post, index) => (
        <div key={index} className="emoji-post">
          {post.content}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export default EmojiFeed;
