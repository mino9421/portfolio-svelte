# Node.js

## Overview
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to build scalable network applications using JavaScript on the server side. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it suitable for building high-performance applications.

## My Experience with Node.js
In the Deez social media platform, Node.js was integral to the backend operations, enabling the server-side logic and handling asynchronous operations efficiently. Its non-blocking nature allowed the application to handle multiple concurrent requests seamlessly, contributing to the platform's overall performance and scalability.

## Project-Specific Example
For the Deez project, Node.js was used as the runtime environment to host the API server and manage the application's backend operations. It facilitated the integration of various tools and services, such as tRPC for type-safe APIs and Prisma for database interactions.

### Key Usage
- **API Server**: Node.js powered the API server that communicates with the frontend, handling requests and responses efficiently.
- **Integration**: It integrated various libraries and tools, such as tRPC and Prisma, ensuring smooth interaction between different parts of the stack.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Leveraged Node.js's asynchronous capabilities to handle real-time updates and concurrent connections effectively.

```javascript
// Example code block - Basic Express.js server setup in Node.js

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.json());

// Sample route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
