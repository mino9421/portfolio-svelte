# Svelte

## Overview
Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework that compiles components into highly efficient imperative code, resulting in faster runtime performance and smaller bundle sizes. SvelteKit is a powerful framework built on top of Svelte that provides a full-stack development environment, supporting features like routing, server-side rendering, and more.

## My Experience with Svelte
I have utilized Svelte and SvelteKit to build my entire portfolio, taking advantage of its simplicity and performance benefits. The experience provided me with hands-on knowledge of Svelte's reactive approach to building user interfaces and SvelteKitâ€™s full-stack capabilities.

## Project-Specific Example

### 1. Portfolio Development
Developed my portfolio website using SvelteKit, leveraging its features for creating a dynamic and interactive site. The project allowed me to explore various aspects of Svelte, including component-based architecture, state management, and routing.

#### Key Features Implemented
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Built reusable components for different sections of the portfolio, such as project showcases, skill descriptions, and contact forms.
- **Routing**: Implemented navigation and routing using SvelteKit's built-in capabilities to manage different pages and dynamic routes.
- **Reactive Programming**: Utilized Svelte's reactivity to create a smooth and responsive user experience.

#### Example Code Block
```svelte
<!-- Example code block - Svelte Component for a Portfolio Project -->

<script>
  export let projectTitle;
  export let projectDescription;
</script>

<div class="project">
  <h2>{projectTitle}</h2>
  <p>{projectDescription}</p>
</div>

<style>
  .project {
    padding: 1rem;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 1rem 0;
  }

  h2 {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 1rem;
    color: #555;
  }
</style>
