# tRPC

**tRPC** is a fully typesafe API development tool that allows you to build end-to-end typesafe applications in TypeScript without needing to use REST or GraphQL. It enables communication between the client and server by leveraging TypeScript's type system to ensure that both sides are always in sync.

## How I Used tRPC

In my projects, **tRPC** has been an essential tool for building APIs where type safety is a priority. By using tRPC, I've been able to streamline the development process, ensuring that API endpoints and their associated types are tightly coupled, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors due to mismatched types.

For example, in my T3 Stack project, I utilized **tRPC** to handle server-side logic and API calls, enabling seamless communication between the client and server. The full-stack typesafety that tRPC offers has allowed me to catch errors during the development phase, leading to a more reliable and robust application.

## Advantages of tRPC

- **End-to-End Typesafety**: Ensures that client and server code are always in sync.
- **No Boilerplate**: Unlike REST or GraphQL, tRPC requires no schema definitions, reducing the amount of boilerplate code.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works perfectly with modern frontend frameworks like Next.js and React, making it easy to integrate into full-stack TypeScript projects.
- **Scalability**: Though lightweight, tRPC scales well with the complexity of your application, handling everything from simple queries to complex mutations.
