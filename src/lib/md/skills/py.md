# Python - Machine Learning, AI, and GIS

## Overview
Python is a premier language for machine learning, AI, and GIS due to its rich ecosystem of libraries and tools. My experience spans a range of projects involving data manipulation, model training, predictive analytics, and geographic information systems.

## My Experience with Machine Learning, AI, and GIS
I have applied Python extensively in machine learning and AI projects, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and more. Additionally, I have worked with GIS tools and libraries to handle spatial data and perform geographic analyses.

## Project-Specific Examples

### 1. Disease Prediction (e.g., COVID-19 Detection)
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, using historical data and various features.

#### Key Technologies Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array management.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms and evaluating model performance.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For developing deep learning models, if applicable.

#### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared datasets using Pandas and NumPy.
- **Model Training**: Trained models using Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow for accurate predictions.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

```python
# Example code block - Disease Prediction with Scikit-Learn

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('disease_data.csv')

# Prepare features and labels
X = data.drop('disease', axis=1)
y = data['disease']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
print(report)
