## Project Structure

The portfolio's architecture is clean and well-organized, promoting maintainability and ease of use. Here's how it's structured:

- **Static Assets**: All static assets, including logos, background images, and other media, are stored in the `static` directory. This ensures that all resources are neatly organized and readily accessible.

## Key Features
